 *
 * Important details:
 * - A goal is only valid if the *entire ball* (taking BALL_RADIUS into account)
 *   has crossed the goal line.
 * - The ball must be vertically contained between the goal posts.
 * - The right goal corresponds to Team 1 scoring.
 * - The left goal corresponds to Team 2 scoring.
 * @return
 * - 1 if Team 1 scores,
 * - 2 if Team 2 scores,
 * - 0 if no goal has occurred.
